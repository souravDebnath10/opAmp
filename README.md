Triangular wave generator is made here using two op-amp 741. There is two circuits here, one is schmitt trigger circuit which is responsible for generating square wave and followed by an integrator which inegrates the square wave and makes it triangular. The values of the components used are as follows C=0.1 microFarad, R1=1 Kohm, R2 = 220 ohm, R3 is varied as per input frequency.
